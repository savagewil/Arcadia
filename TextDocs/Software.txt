Our team is multilingual.
We have three separate programing teams for our robot.
Java, C++, and Lab View

The teams work with a shared Algorithm,
however each team implements this in their own language.
The different mentalities each language brings
helps us find better solutions to programing problems.
The separate versions of the Algorithm also allow us to
have backups in case one of the Languages is having problems

We also use Python and SQL in some of our independent Projects,
And HTTP and CSS in our team website
